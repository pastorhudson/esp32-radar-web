INAV RADAR ESP32 CHANGELOG
--------------------------

*** 3.0.2 (2022/05/02)

- For each supported boards, added extra firmwares that defaults to 868 and 915MHz, for Bluetooth-free installation on non-433MHz modules, and also for boards without a button (so not capable to start the BT configuration mode)

*** 3.0.1 (2021/12/29)

- Fixed the full-reset-with-button
- Added an option to force the ground station mode


*** 3.0 (2021/12/27)

- Added a basic configuration process, with a Bluetooth terminal
- Added 2 extra Lora modes (long range, fast)
- One firmware per target, Lora band defaults to 433MHz, must be set with the BT for 868 or 915MHz
- Lora library updated to newest version
- Other tweaks and changes
- Supported ESP32 boards : Lilygo v1.0/1.3, v1.4, v1.6, v2.0


*** 2.2 (2021/10/13)

- Fixed a bug with anodes getting permanently marked as lost when going out of range for more than 30 seconds
- Adjusted the LoRa frequencies for 433MHz (433.375) and 868MHz (868.500)
- All nodes must run the same firmware version, because of the new LoRa frequencies and a critical fix


*** 2.1 (2021/09/06)

- New air protocol, fixing a bug with negative longitudes, thanks to Notamed Closed for the find. 
- Improved accuracy for speed (From 1.8km/h to 0.72km/h)
- Improved accuracy for the heading (From 6° to 1°)
- Higher max range for altitude (From 4096 to 8192 meters)
- Drift correction won't happen when the node is alone, to greatly improve chances of reconnection when multiples nodes are going out then back in range.
- All nodes must run the same v2.1 firmware, because of the new air protocol


*** 2.0 (2021/05/07)

- New air protocol (single frame type, faster, simpler)
- Fixed a bug at boot where the second ESP32 would have trouble to sync on the first because of the "randomization-if-solo" feature
- Improved the smoothness of the OSD display in INAV, now it gets each node position at 4Hz instead of 1Hz
- Added movement compensation, to correct the position of a moving node
- Added a GCS host type for a ground station (MWP)
- Added basic BlueTooth support for debugging
- Network settings : Same as v1.6 : 4 nodes, cycle time 250ms (4x250ms)
- All nodes must run the same v2.0 firmware, because of the new air protocol


*** 1.6 (2021/01/31)

- Improved range, and minor optimizations (require all nodes to have 1.6, because new LoRa settings)


*** 1.5.1 (2020/12/04)

- Wait for the host to reply for 9 secondes instead of 4, to account for INAV 2.6 slower boot


*** 1.5 (2020/02/11)

- Improved timings for better out-of-range resistance (4 slots of 150ms = total cycle 600ms)
- Code cleanup


*** 1.4 (2019/06/18)

- Full compatibility with iNav 2.2 (require iNav 2.2.RC1 or newer)
- More datas transmitted between nodes
- Timing optimizations
- New air protocol, all nodes must run the same firmware version


*** 1.3 (2019/05/18)

- Radar logo at boot
- Better timings, greatly reduced display latency
- Many cosmetic tweaks and fixes
- Newest inav 2.2.dev REQUIRED (built 2019/05/18 or newer)


*** 1.2 (2019/05/14)

- Better timing for MSP and air packets
- 5 nodes capable, but locked at 4 nodes for now
- Faster rate for MSP messages to improve tracking accuracy
- in iNav 2.2, faster display to reduce tracking stuttering
- Known issue : sometime the debug page with the timings reboots the module


*** 1.1 (2019/05/11)

- MSP2 messages for compatibility with iNav 2.2
- Fixed several issues
- Smoother tracking
- Improved OLED pages
- Improved air timing
- Now sharing the vBat, mAh, RSSI


*** 1.0 (2019/04/25)

- Initial release
- Require iNav 2.2-dev, including the latest version for the Hud branch (build date 2019/04/27 or newer)
- Cycle time 500ms, slotspacing 125ms, LoRA SF9 bw250, maximum 4 nodes (you + 3 others)
